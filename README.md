<img src="Recipient_badge.jpg" width="400" height="400">

This repository contains my journey through the "AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program." In this program, I will learn the foundations of AI and machine learning, gained proficiency in Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and linear algebra, and build the skills necessary to create neural networks.

## Program Overview

The "AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program" provided a comprehensive introduction to the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Throughout the program, will covered a wide range of topics and developed the following skills:

- **Python:** I honed my Python programming skills, becoming proficient in this versatile language, which is a fundamental tool in AI and data science.

- **NumPy and Pandas:** I learned how to efficiently manipulate and analyze data using NumPy and Pandas, essential libraries for data processing.

- **Matplotlib:** I mastered data visualization with Matplotlib, enabling me to create clear and informative graphs and charts.

- **PyTorch:** The program equipped me with the knowledge and skills to work with PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

- **Linear Algebra:** I gained a solid foundation in linear algebra, a crucial mathematical concept for understanding the inner workings of neural networks.

- **Neural Networks:** I learned how to design, train, and evaluate neural networks, and I built a strong understanding of the architecture and principles behind this technology.

# AI Programming Nanodegree Program Progress Report

## Week 1 - Oct 16, 2023
Hey there! ğŸ‘‹ So, in the first week of the AI Programming Nanodegree, we got our feet wet with some key introductory lessons. We covered essentials like:
- Welcome to AI Programming with Python
- How to Get Help
- Navigating Your Account

### Project Kick-off
We also started diving into the hands-on stuff by working on and submitting our first project. The task was to use a pre-trained image classifier to identify different dog breeds. Additionally, we had a welcome session where we got acquainted with the program structure, expectations, support systems, and the crucial projects we need to complete to graduate.

## Week 2 - Oct 23, 2023
Moving on to the second week! ğŸš€ We delved into the world of Python specifically tailored for AI programmers. The focus was on:
- Understanding why Python is crucial in this field
- Grasping various data types and operators

### More on the Dog Breed Project
And of course, we continued with our project, refining our skills in utilizing a pre-trained image classifier for dog breed identification. The journey was intense, but hey, progress feels good!

## Week 3 - Oct 30, 2023
Now, for week three! ğŸŒŸ We dug deeper into Python for AI programmers, tackling:
- Data Structures
- Control Flow
- Functions

### Project Wrap-up
In parallel with our lessons, we kept working on our dog breed identification project. The final touch was a walkthrough of the project, solidifying our understanding and skills.

That's a quick overview of the exciting three weeks we've had. More to come! ğŸš€
